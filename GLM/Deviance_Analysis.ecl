  * Analysis of Deviance Report.
  * <p>Compare deviance information between two models, a base and and proposed
  * model.
  *
  * <p>Analysis of Deviance is analogous to the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) used in
  * least-squares modeling, but adapted to the general linear model (GLM).  In this case
  * it is adapted specifically to the logistic model.
  *
  * <p>The inputs are the deviance records for each model as obtained from a call
  * to Model_Deviance.
  *
  * @param proposed deviance records of the proposed model.
  * @param base deviance records of the base model for comparison.
  * @return the comparison of the deviance between the models in AOD_Record format.
  * @see Model_Deviance
